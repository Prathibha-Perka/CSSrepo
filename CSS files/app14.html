            <p>Purple has the balance of red’s stimulation and blue’s calming properties. It is traditionally associated with royalty, majesty, and nobility as well as having a spiritual or mysterious quality. Darker shades often represent luxury or opulence, while lighter shades are quite feminine, sentimental, and even nostalgic.</p>
